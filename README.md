# Plant watering system
I wrote this code for an Arduino UNO microcontroller when I attended an Arduino course while doing my PhD in Biochemistry.
This was my project work at the end of the course. I chose this topic because I have some flowers and I thought maybe I can even use this setup to water my plants (with some modifications).
